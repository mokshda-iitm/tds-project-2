give me steps to follow to make this project work


To make your project work, you need to follow a series of steps to set up both the backend (your FastAPI API) and the frontend (your index.html file) and expose your local server to the internet using ngrok.

1. Backend Setup (FastAPI & Uvicorn)
Create Your API: Write your Python code (main.py) using FastAPI. This file contains the logic for your data analyst agent, including the / and /api/ endpoints.

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed.

Bash

pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas matplotlib seaborn requests python-dotenv python-multipart
Run the Server: Start your FastAPI application locally using uvicorn. This will run the server, typically at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Keep this terminal window open.

Bash

uvicorn main:app --reload
2. Frontend Setup (index.html)
Create an HTML file: In the same folder as your Python code, create a file named index.html.

Add the JavaScript: Place the HTML and JavaScript code from the previous responses into this file. This code is responsible for making a POST request to your API and displaying the results.

3. Public Exposure (Ngrok)
Install Ngrok: Download and install the ngrok CLI on your system.

Start the Tunnel: Open a new terminal window and run ngrok to create a public URL for your local server. Ngrok will provide a temporary URL (e.g., https://<unique-id>.ngrok-free.app).

Bash

ngrok http 8000
Update Your Frontend: Copy the new ngrok URL and paste it into the index.html file, replacing the placeholder URL in the JavaScript code.
